# ðŸ˜ˆ Users

This folder contains user modules. `default.nix` provides a generic module for user configurations. Every sub-folder provides user specific configurations (user name being the folder name).

For user named as `{x}`, it is required to have a `{x}HashedPassword.age` secret file for storing hashed password generated by `mkpasswd`.
