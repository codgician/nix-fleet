# :snowflake: Nix Fleet

![Man hours](https://manhours.aiursoft.cn/r/github.com/codgician/nix-fleet.svg)

My fleet of Nix-managed devices.

## Quick start

Start developing with your own flavor of shell:

```
nix develop -c $SHELL
```

Don't have nix flake support? Try this instead:

```
nix-shell
```

Format the nix code:

```
nix fmt
```
