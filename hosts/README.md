## Naming convention

Version: *0.1-202403*

Host names are named after characters from [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/), an open-world adventure game proudly presented by HoYoverse. 

* Different hosts should be named after different characters. For characters having multiple names, the name of its human appearance should be used.
* Hosts running **Unix-like** OS should be named after female characters. Others should be named after male characters. 
    * This rule does not apply to hosts intending to be hypervisor-only.
* Hosts featuring **aarch64** architecture should be named after characters from [*Fontaine*](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fontaine) (or *Fontainians*). 
    * Fontaine people are unique due to originating from [*Oceanid*](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Oceanid), and that sure is a different architecture.
* Virtual machines should be named after [*Archon*](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Seven) or [*Dragon*](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon).
    * Metaphor of being immortal, and can be transformed into multiple forms (just like how VMs could be migrated across different hosts).
* Bare metal non-IoT machines should be named after human characters.
    * They are not immortal and will finally reach end of life some day, physically.
* IoT machines should be named after characters that are not human, archon or dragon, including but not limited to [*Melusine*](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Melusine) and [*Aranara*](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Aranara).
    * Although usually unnoticed by human, they are also a critical part of the Teyvat continent.
